with significant developments across various sectors. Key findings include:\n","\n","1. **Generative AI Trends**: The trend is shifting from integrating AI as a feature to embracing an AI-first approach in application development. This includes advances in coding assistants and AI agents that automate customer interactions and decision-making, marking a significant transformation in software as a service (SaaS).\n","\n","2. **Government Initiatives**: There's increasing focus on AI regulation, with bipartisan task forces, state legislation, and international collaborations aiming to establish frameworks for ethical AI use. A notable example is the US's International Network of AI Safety Institutes.\n","\n","3. **Corporate AI Adoption**: Companies like Yahoo Japan mandate daily AI tool usage to enhance productivity, while startups like Everlab raise significant funding to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions. Additionally, major firms like Microsoft and Amazon are investing heavily in AI technologies and tools.\n","\n","4. **AI's Impact on Employment**: Automation through AI is causing significant layoffs, leading to concerns about job security. Executives warn that millions of white-collar jobs are at risk, driving a call for greater reskilling initiatives.\n","\n","5. **Healthcare Advances**: AI is making strides in preventative care, with models accurately detecting diseases like diabetic retinopathy and lung cancer, showcasing its potential to enhance healthcare access and outcomes.\n","\n","6. **Ethical Concerns**: Issues surrounding AI's role in misinformation, bias in algorithms, and the need for transparency are prompting calls for stricter governance. Notably, the use of AI in political contexts has raised significant debate about its implications on democracy and public perception.\n","\n","These findings underscore the multifaceted impact of AI on industries, society, and governance, indicating a transformative shift reshaping both operational frameworks and ethical considerations.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":646},"id":"83865184","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754213416299,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1295,"user":{"displayName":"Ekroop Singh","userId":"07546242468994500414"}},"outputId":"1e7d34ac-6713-43a9-a711-26b3b63d9343"},"source":["import gradio as gr\n","import requests\n","import os\n","import asyncio\n","\n","async def get_urls_from_serper(query):\n","    \"\"\"Fetches search results URLs from Serper API.\"\"\"\n","    api_key = os.environ.get(\"SERPER_API_KEY\")\n","    url = \"https://google.serper.dev/search\"\n","    headers = {\n","        'X-API-KEY': api_key,\n","        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n","    }\n","    payload = {\n","        \"q\": query,\n","        \"num\": 3 # Number of search results\n","    }\n","    try:\n","        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)\n","        response.raise_for_status()\n","        data = response.json()\n","        search_results = []\n","        if 'organic' in data:\n","            for item in data['organic'][:3]:\n","                search_results.append({'title': item.get('title'), 'url': item.get('link')})\n","        return search_results\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Error fetching search results from Serper API: {e}\")\n","        return []\n","\n","async def summarize_search_results(query):\n","    \"\"\"Performs search, scrapes content, and summarizes using OpenAI.\"\"\"\n","    urls = await get_urls_from_serper(query)\n","    if not urls:\n","        return \"Could not retrieve search results from Serper API.\"\n","\n","    summary = await search_and_summarize(urls)\n","    return summary\n","\n","\n","#Gradio interface\n","iface = gr.Interface(\n","    fn=lambda query: asyncio.run(summarize_search_results(query)),\n","    inputs=gr.Textbox(label=\"Enter your search query\"),\n","    outputs=gr.Textbox(label=\"Summary\"),\n","    title=\"Serper API Search and Summarization\",\n","    description=\"Enter a search query to get a summary of the top search results using Serper API and OpenAI.\"\n",")\n","\n","\n","iface.launch()"],"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["It looks like you are running Gradio on a hosted Jupyter notebook, which requires `share=True`.
