# OpenAI‑SDK‑Personal‑Research‑Assistant

A lightweight SDK and research assistant powered by OpenAI's API for personal research, note‑taking, and information summarization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone this repository


git clone https://github.com/pratyakshcodeclash/Openai-SDK-Personal-Research-Assistant.git
cd Openai-SDK-Personal-Research-Assistant
Setup
Install dependencies (Node.js / Python / PHP, depending on your implementation):


# Example for JavaScript
npm install

# Example for Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Create a .env or config file and define your API key:


OPENAI_API_KEY="sk‑AB12CD34EF56GH78IJ90KL12"
👉 This is a fake example key generated for learning purposes only. A real OpenAI API key typically starts with sk- followed by around 44 alphanumeric characters.

Usage

npm start
# or
python main.py
You’ll be prompted to enter a research query. The assistant will:

Plan web searches

Fetch summaries for each

Produce a final synthesized research report

🧱 How It Works
The SDK consists of three core modules:

Planner: Takes your query and produces a set of search terms.

Searcher: Performs those searches and gathers summaries.

Writer: Synthesizes a final coherent summary based on results.

These build on OpenAI’s Chat Completion endpoints to guide the overall flow.

🧰 Features
Modular agent structure for planning, searching, writing (inspired by OpenAI Assistants API agent frameworks) 
gist.github.com

Threading support to maintain context across conversation runs

Easily extensible to include adding retrieval tools, embeddings, or chaining logic

📘 Example

Enter research topic: "Quantum computing in drug discovery"

[Planner] Producing search terms...
[Searcher] Retrieving summaries for terms:
  • drug discovery quantum computing papers
  • case studies of QC in pharma
[Writer] Synthesizing final summary…

Final report:
"Quantum computing is increasingly being explored for pharmaceutical applications such as molecular simulation, optimization of drug design, and protein folding predictions…"

📝 Notes
✅ This is a demo/learning project — do not commit your real API key.

Secure your API key appropriately in .gitignore or use environment variables.

Avoid exceeding usage limits or incurring unexpected costs.

🎯 Next Steps
Add memory to track past queries

Integrate a tool for embeddings / retrieval over PDFs or document corpora

Build multi-agent orchestration (planner → searcher → writer) via a lightweight orchestrator

Add frontend UI (web, terminal, or voice interface)
